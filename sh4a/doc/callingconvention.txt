       SH Options

       These -m options are defined for the SH implementations:

       -m1 Generate code for the SH1.

       -m2 Generate code for the SH2.

       -m2e
           Generate code for the SH2e.

       -m3 Generate code for the SH3.

       -m3e
           Generate code for the SH3e.

       -m4-nofpu
           Generate code for the SH4 without a floating-point unit.

       -m4-single-only
           Generate code for the SH4 with a floating-point unit that only sup-
           ports single-precision arithmetic.

       -m4-single
           Generate code for the SH4 assuming the floating-point unit is in
           single-precision mode by default.

       -m4 Generate code for the SH4.

       -m4a-nofpu
           Generate code for the SH4al-dsp, or for a SH4a in such a way that
           the floating-point unit is not used.

       -m4a-single-only
           Generate code for the SH4a, in such a way that no double-precision
           floating point operations are used.

       -m4a-single
           Generate code for the SH4a assuming the floating-point unit is in
           single-precision mode by default.

       -m4a
           Generate code for the SH4a.

       -m4al
           Same as -m4a-nofpu, except that it implicitly passes -dsp to the
           assembler.  GCC doesn't generate any DSP instructions at the
           moment.

       -mb Compile code for the processor in big endian mode.

       -ml Compile code for the processor in little endian mode.

       -mdalign
           Align doubles at 64-bit boundaries.  Note that this changes the
           calling conventions, and thus some functions from the standard C
           library will not work unless you recompile it first with -mdalign.

       -mrelax
           Shorten some address references at link time, when possible; uses
           the linker option -relax.

       -mbigtable
           Use 32-bit offsets in "switch" tables.  The default is to use
           16-bit offsets.

       -mfmovd
           Enable the use of the instruction "fmovd".

       -mhitachi
           Comply with the calling conventions defined by Renesas.

       -mrenesas
           Comply with the calling conventions defined by Renesas.

       -mno-renesas
           Comply with the calling conventions defined for GCC before the
           Renesas conventions were available.  This option is the default for
           all targets of the SH toolchain except for sh-symbianelf.

       -mnomacsave
           Mark the "MAC" register as call-clobbered, even if -mhitachi is
           given.

       -mieee
           Increase IEEE-compliance of floating-point code.  At the moment,
           this is equivalent to -fno-finite-math-only.  When generating 16
           bit SH opcodes, getting IEEE-conforming results for comparisons of
           NANs / infinities incurs extra overhead in every floating point
           comparison, therefore the default is set to -ffinite-math-only.

       -misize
           Dump instruction size and location in the assembly code.

       -mpadstruct
           This option is deprecated.  It pads structures to multiple of 4
           bytes, which is incompatible with the SH ABI.

       -mspace
           Optimize for space instead of speed.  Implied by -Os.

       -mprefergot
           When generating position-independent code, emit function calls
           using the Global Offset Table instead of the Procedure Linkage Ta-
           ble.

       -musermode
           Generate a library function call to invalidate instruction cache
           entries, after fixing up a trampoline.  This library function call
           doesn't assume it can write to the whole memory address space.
           This is the default when the target is "sh-*-linux*".

       -multcost=number
           Set the cost to assume for a multiply insn.

       -mdiv=strategy
           Set the division strategy to use for SHmedia code.  strategy must
           be one of: call, call2, fp, inv, inv:minlat, inv20u, inv20l,
           inv:call, inv:call2, inv:fp .  "fp" performs the operation in
           floating point.  This has a very high latency, but needs only a few
           instructions, so it might be a good choice if your code has enough
           easily exploitable ILP to allow the compiler to schedule the float-
           ing point instructions together with other instructions.  Division
           by zero causes a floating point exception.  "inv" uses integer
           operations to calculate the inverse of the divisor, and then multi-
           plies the dividend with the inverse.  This strategy allows cse and
           hoisting of the inverse calculation.  Division by zero calculates
           an unspecified result, but does not trap.  "inv:minlat" is a vari-
           ant of "inv" where if no cse / hoisting opportunities have been
           found, or if the entire operation has been hoisted to the same
           place, the last stages of the inverse calculation are intertwined
           with the final multiply to reduce the overall latency, at the
           expense of using a few more instructions, and thus offering fewer
           scheduling opportunities with other code.  "call" calls a library
           function that usually implements the inv:minlat strategy.  This
           gives high code density for m5-*media-nofpu compilations.  "call2"
           uses a different entry point of the same library function, where it
           assumes that a pointer to a lookup table has already been set up,
           which exposes the pointer load to cse / code hoisting optimiza-
           tions.  "inv:call", "inv:call2" and "inv:fp" all use the "inv"
           algorithm for initial code generation, but if the code stays unop-
           timized, revert to the "call", "call2", or "fp" strategies, respec-
           tively.  Note that the potentially-trapping side effect of division
           by zero is carried by a separate instruction, so it is possible
           that all the integer instructions are hoisted out, but the marker
           for the side effect stays where it is.  A recombination to fp oper-
           ations or a call is not possible in that case.  "inv20u" and
           "inv20l" are variants of the "inv:minlat" strategy.  In the case
           that the inverse calculation was nor separated from the multiply,
           they speed up division where the dividend fits into 20 bits (plus
           sign where applicable), by inserting a test to skip a number of
           operations in this case; this test slows down the case of larger
           dividends.  inv20u assumes the case of a such a small dividend to
           be unlikely, and inv20l assumes it to be likely.

       -mdivsi3_libfunc=name
           Set the name of the library function used for 32 bit signed divi-
           sion to name.  This only affect the name used in the call and
           inv:call division strategies, and the compiler will still expect
           the same sets of input/output/clobbered registers as if this option
           was not present.

       -madjust-unroll
           Throttle unrolling to avoid thrashing target registers.  This
           option only has an effect if the gcc code base supports the TAR-
           GET_ADJUST_UNROLL_MAX target hook.

       -mindexed-addressing
           Enable the use of the indexed addressing mode for SHmedia32/SHcom-
           pact.  This is only safe if the hardware and/or OS implement 32 bit
           wrap-around semantics for the indexed addressing mode.  The archi-
           tecture allows the implementation of processors with 64 bit MMU,
           which the OS could use to get 32 bit addressing, but since no cur-
           rent hardware implementation supports this or any other way to make
           the indexed addressing mode safe to use in the 32 bit ABI, the
           default is -mno-indexed-addressing.

       -mgettrcost=number
           Set the cost assumed for the gettr instruction to number.  The
           default is 2 if -mpt-fixed is in effect, 100 otherwise.

       -mpt-fixed
           Assume pt* instructions won't trap.  This will generally generate
           better scheduled code, but is unsafe on current hardware.  The cur-
           rent architecture definition says that ptabs and ptrel trap when
           the target anded with 3 is 3.  This has the unintentional effect of
           making it unsafe to schedule ptabs / ptrel before a branch, or
           hoist it out of a loop.  For example, __do_global_ctors, a part of
           libgcc that runs constructors at program startup, calls functions
           in a list which is delimited by -1.  With the -mpt-fixed option,
           the ptabs will be done before testing against -1.  That means that
           all the constructors will be run a bit quicker, but when the loop
           comes to the end of the list, the program crashes because ptabs
           loads -1 into a target register.  Since this option is unsafe for
           any hardware implementing the current architecture specification,
           the default is -mno-pt-fixed.  Unless the user specifies a specific
           cost with -mgettrcost, -mno-pt-fixed also implies -mgettrcost=100;
           this deters register allocation using target registers for storing
           ordinary integers.

       -minvalid-symbols
           Assume symbols might be invalid.  Ordinary function symbols gener-
           ated by the compiler will always be valid to load with
           movi/shori/ptabs or movi/shori/ptrel, but with assembler and/or
           linker tricks it is possible to generate symbols that will cause
           ptabs / ptrel to trap.  This option is only meaningful when
           -mno-pt-fixed is in effect.  It will then prevent cross-basic-block
           cse, hoisting and most scheduling of symbol loads.  The default is
           -mno-invalid-symbols.

File: as.info,  Node: SH-Chars,  Next: SH-Regs,  Up: SH Syntax

8.28.2.1 Special Characters
...........................

`!' is the line comment character.

   You can use `;' instead of a newline to separate statements.

   Since `$' has no special meaning, you may use it in symbol names.


File: as.info,  Node: SH-Regs,  Next: SH-Addressing,  Prev: SH-Chars,  Up: SH Syntax

8.28.2.2 Register Names
.......................

You can use the predefined symbols `r0', `r1', `r2', `r3', `r4', `r5',
`r6', `r7', `r8', `r9', `r10', `r11', `r12', `r13', `r14', and `r15' to
refer to the SH registers.

   The SH also has these control registers:

`pr'
     procedure register (holds return address)

`pc'
     program counter

`mach'
`macl'
     high and low multiply accumulator registers

`sr'
     status register

`gbr'
     global base register

`vbr'
     vector base register (for interrupt vectors)

8.28.2.3 Addressing Modes
.........................

`as' understands the following addressing modes for the SH.  `RN' in
the following refers to any of the numbered registers, but _not_ the
control registers.

`RN'
     Register direct

`@RN'
     Register indirect

`@-RN'
     Register indirect with pre-decrement

`@RN+'
     Register indirect with post-increment

`@(DISP, RN)'
     Register indirect with displacement

`@(R0, RN)'
     Register indexed

`@(DISP, GBR)'
     `GBR' offset

`@(R0, GBR)'
     GBR indexed

`ADDR'
`@(DISP, PC)'
     PC relative address (for branch or for addressing memory).  The
     `as' implementation allows you to use the simpler form ADDR
     anywhere a PC relative address is called for; the alternate form
     is supported for compatibility with other assemblers.

`#IMM'
     Immediate data


File: as.info,  Node: SH Floating Point,  Next: SH Directives,  Prev: SH Syntax,  Up: SH-Dependent

8.28.3 Floating Point
---------------------

SH2E, SH3E and SH4 groups have on-chip floating-point unit (FPU). Other
SH groups can use `.float' directive to generate IEEE floating-point
numbers.

   SH2E and SH3E support single-precision floating point calculations as
well as entirely PCAPI compatible emulation of double-precision
floating point calculations. SH2E and SH3E instructions are a subset of
the floating point calculations conforming to the IEEE754 standard.

   In addition to single-precision and double-precision floating-point
operation capability, the on-chip FPU of SH4 has a 128-bit graphic
engine that enables 32-bit floating-point data to be processed 128 bits
at a time. It also supports 4 * 4 array operations and inner product
operations. Also, a superscalar architecture is employed that enables
simultaneous execution of two instructions (including FPU
instructions), providing performance of up to twice that of
conventional architectures at the same frequency.


File: as.info,  Node: SH Directives,  Next: SH Opcodes,  Prev: SH Floating Point,  Up: SH-Dependent

8.28.4 SH Machine Directives
----------------------------

`uaword'
`ualong'
     `as' will issue a warning when a misaligned `.word' or `.long'
     directive is used.  You may use `.uaword' or `.ualong' to indicate
     that the value is intentionally misaligned.

8.28.5 Opcodes
--------------

For detailed information on the SH machine instruction set, see
`SH-Microcomputer User's Manual' (Renesas) or `SH-4 32-bit CPU Core
Architecture' (SuperH) and `SuperH (SH) 64-Bit RISC Series' (SuperH).

   `as' implements all the standard SH opcodes.  No additional
pseudo-instructions are needed on this family.  Note, however, that
because `as' supports a simpler form of PC-relative addressing, you may
simply write (for example)

     mov.l  bar,r0

where other assemblers might require an explicit displacement to `bar'
from the program counter:

     mov.l  @(DISP, PC)

   Here is a summary of SH opcodes:
