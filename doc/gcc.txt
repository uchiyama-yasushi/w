The "earlyclobber" modifier can be added to output operands
(e.g. "=&r") to make sure GCC uses different registers for input and
output operands. GCC assumes that the output operands are not used
before the code is done with all input operands and reuses the input
registers for output operands. If there are a lot of statements an
output operand may be used before the code is finished with the input
operands.
